Surveillance of COVID-19 Patients Using Drones: A Survey

We aim to use autonomous drones for delivery, and reduce human interaction, so as to reduce the risk of infection. 

This will help in automizing the control and maintaining social distancing.

We used open source packages for the autonomous drones and the path planning was done using Q Learning, which maximized the rewards and took the appropriate action. 

The main goal of the project was to implement vision-based landing on an autonomous drone.
